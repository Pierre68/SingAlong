Summer has come and passed
13000
The innocent can never last
18000
Wake me up when September ends
27000
Like my father's come to pass
32000
Seven years has gone so fast
37000
Wake me up when September ends
46000
Here comes the rain again
50000
Falling from the stars
55000
Drenched in my pain again
59000
Becoming who we are
64000
As my memory rests
68000
But never forgets what I lost
74000
Wake me up when September ends

Summer has come and passed
100000
The innocent can never last
105000
Wake me up when September ends
114000
Ring out the bells again
119000
Like we did when spring began
124000
Wake me up when September ends
131000
Here comes the rain again
136000
Falling from the stars
141000
Drenched in my pain again
146000
Becoming who we are
150000
As my memory rests
155000
But never forgets what I lost
160000
Wake me up when September ends
167000

Summer has come and passed
208000
The innocent can never last
212000
Wake me up when September ends
222000
Like my father's come to pass
226000
Twenty years has gone so fast
230000
Wake me up when September ends
239000
Wake me up when September ends
249000
Wake me up when September ends
