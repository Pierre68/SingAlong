8000
Do you ever feel
9000
Like a plastic bag
11000
Drifting through the wind
12000
Wanting to start again
13000
Do you ever feel
15000
Feel so paper-thin
14000
Like a house of cards
16000
One blow from caving in
17000
Do you ever feel
18000
Already buried deep
19000
Six feet under
20000
Screams but no one seems to hear a thing
22000
Do you know that there's
Still a chance for you
'Cause there's a spark in you
You just gotta

Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show them what you're worth
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave them all in awe

You don't have to feel
Like a waste of space
You're original
Cannot be replaced

If you only knew
What the future holds
After a hurricane
Comes a rainbow

Maybe the reason why
All the doors are closed
So you could open one
That leads you to the perfect road

Like a lightning bolt
Your heart will glow
And when it's time you know
You just gotta

Ignite the light
And let it shine
Just own the night
Like the Fourth of July

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show them what you're worth
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave them all in awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
It's always been inside of you, you, you
And now it's time to let it through

'Cause baby, you're a firework
Come on show them what you're worth
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
As you shoot across the sky

Baby, you're a firework
Come on let your colors burst
Make them go, "Oh, oh, oh"
You're gonna leave them all in awe

Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
Boom, boom, boom
Even brighter than the moon, moon, moon
